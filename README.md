Description

During Learning Phase 2 participants in the Cloud track of the GADS 2020 program shall be encouraged to explore the possibilities and opportunities to work with the gcloud SDK more in detail.

All Google Cloud learners have access to multiple learning channels on Pluralsight. Each channel provides access to several video courses, and you have access to various labs through Qwiklabs. 

The total of hands-on labs is 168 labs (as of writing). All links are provided below as an annex.
